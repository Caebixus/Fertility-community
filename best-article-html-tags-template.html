<h3>Who They Are</h3>

<p>IVF CUBE was founded in 2011. They have a large, dedicated staff led by Hana Visnova, MD, Ph.D., and Renata Huttelova, Ph.D., MBA.</p>

<p>Dr. Visnova has worked in reproductive medicine and obstetrics and gynecology for over 25 years. She is compassionate towards her patients and says that she always tries to treat them as she would her best friends. She's fluent in both English and German.</p>

<p>Dr. Huttelova has also had over 25 years of experience working with IVF. She's a senior ESHRE embryologist and is fluent in English.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What They Offer</h3>

<p>IVF CUBE offers infertility treatment and also provides infertility testing to help patients better understand where their issues lie. During a patient's first visit, IVF CUBE performs an examination on both the male and female to determine the possible causes of infertility. They determine the best treatment based on the causes.</p>

<p>The main treatments they offer include IVF-ICSI with the patient's own eggs or using donor eggs, sperm, or embryos. They only offer IVF-ICSI, not standard IVF. ICSI injects a single sperm directly into the egg, increasing the chances of fertilization.</p>

<p>In accordance with Czech law, they don't treat same-sex couples, single females, or women over the age of 49. They also require that all donors be anonymous.</p>
