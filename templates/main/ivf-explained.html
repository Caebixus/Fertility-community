        <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><b>IVF Explained</b></h2>
        <p>Maybe you have already heard of IVF. What does the acronym actually stand for? It means In Vitro Fertilization and it is a method of assisted reproductive technology. How does it work?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Firstly, you will need to take special medication. The reason for that is that you need to make several of your eggs mature and therefore ready to be fertilized. Only then can the eggs be taken out of your body.</p>
        <p>Eggs are extracted, a sperm sample is retrieved, and both samples are then manually combined in a laboratory dish. Then one or more embryos are put into your uterus. If any of them implant in the lining of your uterus, congratulations! You are expecting a baby!</p>
        <br>
        <p>If the classical In Vitro Fertilization does not work for you, there is an alternative. IVF can be carried out both using your own eggs and your partner’s sperm or taking both samples from donors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And how do you know if you are the right patient for this kind of fertility treatment? The final decision should be made by your physician.</p>
        <p>However, IVF is commonly suggested to patients with blocked fallopian tubes, or those who have had them removed, infertile male (including decreased sperm count), women suffering from ovulation disorders, premature ovarian failure, or uterine fibroids, people with a genetic disorder, or in cases of unexplained infertility.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To sum up, this method is used in order to help women get pregnant when natural ways seem to be failing. It is one of the most commons methods of fertility treatment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You should know that however easy this may sound, IVF has several steps and even though it may work on the first try, many people have to go through the process several times in order to get pregnant.</p>
        <p>While the success rates are high, each body is different, and you need to be ready for the option that IVF may not work for you.</p>
        <p>Good news is that if that is the case, there are still several other options waiting for you, such as donor eggs, donor embryos, and other kinds of fertility therapy and treatment. </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><b>IVF Process Timeline</b></h2>
        <p>The whole IVF cycle usually takes around four weeks. Let’s have a look at the five steps you will need to undergo.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p><b><u>Step 1:</u></b> Your doctor prescribes you special fertility medication that stimulate egg production. These pills are called oral contraceptives. The reason for more than one egg being needed is that some of them will not develop and using more eggs makes the success chances higher.</p>
            <p>After this process, your ovaries are checked by a transvaginal ultrasound. Hormone levels are examined using blood test samples.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Step 2:</u></b> Now your eggs need to be retrieved. This is performed through a micro-surgery. No worries, the hollow needle used is guided by ultrasound imaging. Pain and discomfort are avoided using medication.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Step 3:</u></b> At this point, your partner is asked for a sperm sample. The sample is then prepared for combining with your eggs.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Step 4:</u></b> The next step is called insemination. The female and male samples are mixed together and left in a laboratory dish to fertilize.</p>
            <p>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection, often referred to as ICSI, may be used if the probability of success is lower. This is done by injecting a single sperm into one of the eggs. If it works, the eggs become embryos.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Step 5:</u></b> Now it is time for embryo transfer. Three or five days later, one or more embryos are transferred into your uterus. The small tube usually does not call any pain.</p>
            <p>If any of those embryos attach to the lining of your uterus, the process was successful. Be prepared to take a day off the day after the process and get back to your daily life the next day.</p>
            <p>In some cases, pills or shots of progesterone are prescribed for the first 8-10 weeks after the transfer. This only makes it easier for embryo.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><b>IVF Success Tips & Tricks</b></h2>
        <p>Just like with everything else, the success rate of this procedure depends on several factors. These include reproductive history, age, lifestyle, and the cause of infertility.</p>
        <p>The process is the most successful for women under the age of 35 and the least successful for women over 40. </p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend In Vitro Fertilization to females under the age of 43 who have been trying to conceive for two years, or those who have gone through 12 cycles of artificial insemination.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some sources claim that the success rate is only about 15 – 20%, however, there are no official numbers representative for the global population.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If this does not sound promising to you, you will be happy to read that there are certain ways that can make your probabilities higher. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Firstly, do your homework and read about the process you are about to go through. Try more than one source and make sure you understand everything. If you don’t, check the facts with your doctor.</p>
        <p>Your diet may have an impact, too. Make sure you eat “good fats.” According to some scientists, replacing red meat and butter with olive oil, seeds, avocados, and nuts can make it work! Try to avoid or limit food with low glycemic index, alcohol, and coffee.</p>
        <p>Being obese or underweight may both be the reasons you cannot conceive. Make sure you are maintaining a healthy weight. </p>
        <p>Your physical condition doesn’t do if you are not alright mentally. If you are feeling stressed, try meditation, or yoga. However, do not exercise too much if you are trying to conceive. Get a good sleep instead.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><b>Supplements for IVF + IVF Vitamins</b></h2>
        <p>Another way to boost your organism and make fertilization easier is using vitamins and supplements.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><b>Exercise During IVF</b></h2>
        <p>While exercising is in general considered healthy, beneficial and good, scientists have found out that too much physical activity during early weeks of pregnancy can actually be harmful.</p>
        <p>So, what can you do if you want to keep active but do not want to hurt the baby? Fortunately, there are some options.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the activities you can do without putting your future offspring into danger is walking. A low impact activity such as walking increases the endorphin level and helps nutrients release into your body.</p>
        <p>It also makes the amount of oxygen received higher. Try walking 30 minutes every day!</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are not into walking, you might be happy to learn another activity you can do is swimming. Swimming will help you maintain your fitness level without putting too much stress on your body. Both swimming and walking increase blood flow and raise heart rate without overworking your body.</p>
        <p>Option number three is yoga. This activity is not only great for your body, it is also a great mental exercise. Yoga reduces anxiety and stress levels while helping you stay flexible, fit and healthy.</p>
