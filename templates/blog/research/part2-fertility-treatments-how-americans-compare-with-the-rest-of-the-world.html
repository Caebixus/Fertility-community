  <p>Fertility Community recently surveyed our users to get an idea of how Americans compare with the world when it comes to fertility treatments. Our goal was to discover the differences in the types of treatments Americans get compared to the world and how willing Americans are to go out of the country for their fertility treatments.</p>
  <p>Overall, we got some interesting answers that should lead to some new questions for research. Read on to learn more about what we discovered.</p>

    <p>The survey split the respondents into three groups - those who had undergone fertility treatments, those who were thinking about undergoing fertility treatments, and those who had no plans to undergo fertility treatments. It's important to note that not all fertility treatments were IVF.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Out of the respondents, 232 had undergone some type of fertility treatment, a little over 65% of the total. Of those 232, 96 were from the US, meaning US respondents made up 41% of the people who'd had fertility treatments.</p>
    <br>
    <p>88 of the respondents (25%) had yet to have fertility treatment but were considering it. Of those, 53 were American. Americans made up 62% of the respondents who were considering treatment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>37 of the respondents (10%) hadn't undergone fertility treatments and had no plans to in the future. Of those, 31 were American, making up the majority.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 135%"><b>Most Common Fertility Treatments</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Respondents who had undergone fertility treatments were asked about the types of treatments they'd had. It's also important to note that quite a few of the respondents had <u>more than one type</u> of fertility treatment. It's common to start with milder forms of treatment and move to more intensive treatments if those aren't effective.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>While most of the treatments should be familiar, note that natural IVF refers to IVF that doesn't rely on stimulation medication and instead works with a woman's natural cycle. Mild IVF also works with the woman's cycle but also uses stimulants to increase egg production. Mild IVF uses lower doses than standard IVF. </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>65 of the participants had been treated with IUI (intrauterine insemination). Of those, 39 were from the US.</li>
      <li>For natural IVF, 19 participants had undergone treatment. Of those, only two were from the US.</li>
      <li>14 participants had undergone mild IVF, with 9 coming from the US.</li>
      <li>200 respondents had gone through standard IVF. 89 of those were from the US.</li>
      <li>There were 17 respondents who'd undergone IVF using egg donors. Of those, six were from the US.</li>
      <li>23 respondents used IVF with sperm donors with six from the US.</li>
      <li>Only seven participants underwent IVF with embryo donation, six of which were from the US.</li>

    <p>For fertility treatments, the numbers between the US and the rest of the world were relatively the same. Embryo donation and mild IVF seem to be slightly more popular in the US than in other countries, but larger sample size is needed for more accurate statistics.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Standard IVF appears to be the most popular choice for the US and around the world. There may be a few reasons for this popularity. Many patients start with less intense fertility treatment, such as medications or IUI, and if those are unsuccessful, they move on to IVF.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Many people also start with standard IVF, skipping over less intense treatments. Fertility treatments can be expensive and both physically and mentally exhausting. Many people feel that standard IVF is their best chance of getting pregnant, and so they start there.</p>

    <p>These percentages make sense. For many patients, it only takes one treatment to result in a successful pregnancy. However, if the first treatment doesn't work, there are usually more complicated issues. These patients often wind up having several treatments before achieving pregnancy, if at all.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that these numbers reflect people who had done treatments both in their home country and internationally. Some people stayed in their home country but traveled several hours or more to get to the fertility clinic.</p>
    <br>
    <p>These numbers show that most people still seem reluctant to go out of the country for their fertility treatments. There are several reasons people may stay in their home country. They may feel that it's cheaper and easier to stay local. They may feel that their home country offers the best care. For Americans, they may choose not to go with international treatments because most international clinics are very far away.</p>

    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The biggest factor for the majority of people was the clinic's success rate. 128 listed success rate. 62 of those were from the US. </li>
      <li>The second-largest factor was the price. A total of 101 respondents chose price, with 40 of those coming from the US.</li>
      <li>The third biggest factor was the respondent's distance from the fertility clinic. 96 of the respondents chose distance with 45 coming from the US.</li>
      <li>A clinic's reviews and reputations were important, but not as important as success rate and price. 91 of the participants wanted a clinic with a well-known professional medical team, with 31 of those coming from the US.</li>
      <li>70 of the patients valued doctor evaluations when choosing a clinic with 32 coming from America.</li>
      <li>21 respondents wanted clinics with high evaluations on review sites like Trustpilot, etc. 13 of those were from the US.</li>
      <li>The least important factor was the types of fertility treatments a clinic offered. Only 19 respondents listed a variety of treatments offered as a factor, with 10 from the US.</li>

    <p>Respondents were able to fill in their own responses as well. Several respondents chose a clinic based on how they were treated. They wanted to feel like the doctor treated their case individually and that the staff cared about them. A few respondents also chose a clinic based on who their insurance or national healthcare accepted. Respondents also preferred clinics that a friend was happy with. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The three biggest factors make a lot of sense. The success rate is obviously important because people who undergo treatment want the clinic with the best possible results. Price and distance are more practical choices, but since IVF is so expensive, people have to consider the cost and their budgets. Patients also realize that they'll need to visit their IVF clinic at least several times throughout the process, so distance can be an issue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's interesting to note that finding a clinic with several different types of fertility treatments was the least important of the options. It seems counterintuitive that people wouldn't value a clinic with a variety of options. However, this number does line up with the number of people who've had standard IVF. If most people are looking for standard IVF, they can get that at most clinics. </p>

    <br>
    <p>Many patients experience side effects after going through the IVF process, typically when they're in the two-week wait to see if they've achieved pregnancy.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>59 of the participants said they didn't experience any of the side effects after IVF. 27 came from the US. </li>
      <li>Of the participants in this survey, the most common side effect after IVF was mild bloating. 46 patients said they experienced bloating, with 16 coming from the US.</li>
      <li>The second most common side effect after IVF was mild cramping, with 38 participants and 16 of those coming from the US.</li>
      <li>32 of the respondents reported constipation after IVF, with 18 of those coming from the US.</li>
      <li>28 participants experienced breast tenderness. 9 of those came from the US.</li>
      <li>Only 12 of the respondents reported excreted a small amount of blood- or clear-colored fluid after the procedure. Of those, 2 were from the US.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Respondents also had the option to fill in their own side effects. A few said that their bloating and cramping were severe. Two of the participants experienced Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><b>Respondents Considering Fertility Treatments</b></h2>
    <br>
    <p>Quite a few of the survey respondents hadn't undergone any fertility treatments but were considering it. The sample size was 88 participants who were considering treatment, with 53 coming from the US.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature py-3" id="bod3.1">
    <h3 style="font-size: 135%"><b>Respondents' Relationship Statuses</b></h3>
    <p>Respondents considering fertility treatments were asked about their relationship statuses.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>50 participants were in a heterosexual marriage. 29 came from the US. </li>
      <li>24 were single, with 19 coming from the US.</li>
      <li>6 were in an LGBTQ marriage, with 3 participants coming from the US.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>A few respondents were outside the choices. One person was in an LGBTQ relationship but not married and two people were in heterosexual unmarried relationships.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's interesting to note that only 7% of the participants who'd undergone a fertility treatment were single while 30% of those considering treatment are single. This number may be higher because getting pregnant is a big life and financial decision, and it's an even bigger decision to make when one isn't part of a partnership.</p>

    <p>Of the respondents considering fertility treatments:  Five respondents (6%) were between 20-24 and five (6%) were over the age of fifty. Only four respondents (5%) were between 44-49. One respondent was 62 and two were in their late teens. </p>

    <p>Respondents were given several options and asked to choose which types of treatments they were considering.

    <p>23 (26%) were considering mild IVF. 21 respondents (24%) were considering IVF with sperm donors. Only a few participants were considering using egg and embryo donors. Seven (8%) were considering IVF with egg donation, and three (3%) were considering embryo donation. These numbers are also consistent. Most people still place their trust in standard IVF, either for their perceived chances of success or for their budgets</p>

    <br>
    <p>When looking at America vs. the rest of the world, it seems that opinions and decisions are pretty similar. This survey shows that people largely still have traditional views about fertility treatments. Most want affordable, proven treatments. They don't want to travel too far and prefer treatments like standard IVF over less tested treatments like natural and mild IVF. It'll be interesting to see how fertility treatments progress over the next few years as a younger generation reaches the age to start a family.</p>
