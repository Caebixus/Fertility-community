    <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><strong>Why have your fertility treatment abroad?</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>In many cases, it's better to have your fertility treatment abroad. You may be facing many stumbling blocks in your home country that are much easier to overcome in another country.</p>
    <p>For many people, it's much more affordable to have IVF treatments outside of their home country. Certain countries have high costs associated with fertility treatments, making it nearly impossible for some people to afford it. In many situations, your insurance may not cover IVF or any infertility treatments. If the procedure is too expensive to pay out-of-pocket in your own country, it may be affordable elsewhere.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In some cases, infertility clinics in your country may have age limits for the procedure. As women age, the likelihood of pregnancy decreases, even with fertility treatments. Some clinics will not perform IVF on women over a certain age because they deem the pregnancy too risky or because too many older patients will alter their success rates. If you're beyond this age limit, then fertility treatments abroad may be your only option. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Clinics in your country may have a long waiting list. It can take you weeks or months to even see a doctor. If you're using donor eggs, it can take even longer. There may be a waiting list, and it could take months or longer for eggs to become available for you to use. If you're of advanced maternal age, you may not feel you have time to wait. You may be able to go to another country and get seen much more quickly.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You may even find higher success rates and better care at an international facility. Many clinics abroad are at the cutting-edge of research when it comes to fertility treatments. They may employ practices that are safe but have yet to be approved in your own country. These advanced treatments may be the deciding factor in helping you to get pregnant.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><strong>What are the factors to consider when choosing a country for your IVF treatment?</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>There are many factors to consider as you choose a country and then a clinic for your IVF treatment. You can use these factors to compare and narrow down your choices until you find the place that offers exactly what you need.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3 style="font-size: 80%"">Cost</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">The cost of fertility treatments varies from country to country. Many overseas countries offer treatment for considerably lower than places such as the US or the UK.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">More information on costs abroad - <a href="https://www.fertilitycommunity.com/blog/ivf-abroad-costs">What Does IVF Cost Abroad</a>.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 style="font-size: 80%">Effectiveness Rates</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">You don't want to only look at low cost. You need a country and a clinic that reports high effectiveness rates. Lower costs won't be worth it if success rates are low and you wind up having to have the procedure several times.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 style="font-size: 80%">Quality of Care</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">Nothing is more important than your health and the health of your future baby. Read reviews to ensure that the country you choose has regulations in place to assure a high quality of care.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 style="font-size: 80%">Other Factors</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">If you fall into a special group, such as advanced maternal age or a nontraditional family, you'll want to ensure that the country you chooses offers services for you.</p>

      <li>
        <h3 style="font-size: 80%"><a href="https://www.fertilitycommunity.com/fertility-clinics/czech-republic"><strong>Czech Republic</strong></a></h3>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">The Czech Republic is often chosen for overseas IVF treatment because the cost is so much lower than in the US or the UK. As long as clinics are licensed, they should be both safe and effective.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

    <h2 style="font-size: 160%"><strong>Other Factors to Consider When Having IVF Treatments Abroad</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>Whether you have IVF in your home country or abroad, it's not a decision to be made lightly. You should always consider the positives and the negatives when deciding to go outside of the country to have your treatment. Read on to see some of the challenges you may face.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3 style="font-size: 80%"">Different Regulations</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">One of the most significant factors to consider is medical policies and regulations another country may have in place. Regulations may differ significantly from the regulations in your home country. Requirements for care may be different, and clinics may not be required to disclose certain information.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">Your best option to avoid problems with differences in health regulations is to do your research. Find quality documentation to let you know precisely what is required and how things operate in the countries you're considering. You can use this knowledge to guide your decision and let you know which questions you need to ask before committing to a fertility procedure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 style="font-size: 80%">Legal Issues</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">If you leave your own country, you are likely giving up any options for legal recourse in the event of malpractice. While the US and many other countries hold their doctors to certain standards and allow individuals to sue if there is some sort of negligence, other countries may not have this option. While the chances of something going wrong due to malpractice are low, you need to be aware that there may be little you can do if it happens.</p>
